/**
 * @file motor_sim.c
 *
 * The application logic the UI is a view of - a small model of a BLDC drive,
 * standing in for the LP-AM13E230 until the real control loop is wired up.
 *
 * Everything the UI needs arrives as a subject, and nothing in here touches a
 * widget. That is deliberate: it is the same boundary the sibling thermostat
 * draws, and it is what lets motor_sim_publish() be swapped for real sensor
 * reads without a single XML change.
 *
 * What is NOT here is as important as what is. Start/stop, the speed reference,
 * the interlock ticks, the direction choice and clearing the fault log are all
 * written straight from XML by subject_set_int_event / subject_increment_event /
 * bind_checked. This file only ever READS those, and writes what is measured.
